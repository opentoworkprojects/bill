## 🐦 TWITTER/X THREADS (10 Viral Threads)

### Thread 1: "How I Built a Free Restaurant Software"
```
🧵 How I built a FREE restaurant billing software that 500+ restaurants use

A thread on solving real problems 👇

1/ Two years ago, my friend's restaurant was struggling.

Not because of food quality. Not because of location.

Because he was paying ₹25,000/year for a POS system he barely used.

2/ I asked him: "What features do you actually use?"

His answer:
- Billing
- Thermal printing
- Basic reports

That's it. He was paying for 50 features but using 3.

3/ So I built BillByteKOT.

Only the features restaurants actually need:
✅ Billing
✅ KOT system
✅ Thermal printing
✅ Inventory
✅ Reports
✅ WhatsApp integration

No bloat. No complexity.

4/ Pricing strategy:
- FREE for 50 bills/month (perfect for small cafes)
- Premium: ₹499/year (₹41/month)

Why so cheap? Because restaurants deserve better.

5/ Results after 2 years:
- 500+ restaurants using it
- ₹10M+ saved by restaurants
- 4.9/5 rating
- Zero VC funding needed

6/ Key lessons:
- Solve real problems
- Keep it simple
- Price fairly
- Listen to users
- Build in public

7/ If you're a restaurant owner paying too much for software, check out billbytekot.in

If you're a builder, remember: The best products solve real problems.

End/ Thanks for reading! Retweet if you found this valuable 🙏

### Thread 2: "Restaurant Owner's Guide to Saving Money"
```
🧵 10 ways restaurant owners can save ₹1 lakh/year

A practical thread 👇

1/ Switch to affordable billing software
Save: ₹20,000/year

Most POS systems are overpriced. BillByteKOT costs ₹499/year with same features.

That's ₹19,500 saved right there.

2/ Use WhatsApp for customer communication
Save: ₹15,000/year

Stop paying for SMS services. WhatsApp is free and customers prefer it.

BillByteKOT sends bills via WhatsApp automatically.

3/ Track inventory properly
Save: ₹25,000/year

Food waste is killing your profits. Real-time inventory tracking helps you:
- Order right quantities
- Reduce waste
- Prevent theft

4/ Automate reports
Save: ₹10,000/year

Stop paying accountants for basic reports. Good software generates:
- Daily sales reports
- Tax reports
- Inventory reports
- Staff performance

5/ Use digital menus
Save: ₹5,000/year

Stop printing menus every time prices change. QR code menus are:
- Free to update
- Eco-friendly
- COVID-safe

6/ Optimize staff scheduling
Save: ₹15,000/year

Track peak hours. Schedule staff accordingly. Avoid overstaffing during slow hours.

7/ Negotiate with suppliers
Save: ₹8,000/year

Use inventory data to negotiate better rates. Show suppliers your volume.

8/ Reduce paper usage
Save: ₹3,000/year

Digital bills, KOT system, online orders. Less paper = more savings.

9/ Energy efficiency
Save: ₹5,000/year

LED lights, efficient appliances, proper maintenance.
